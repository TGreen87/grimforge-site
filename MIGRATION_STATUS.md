# Next.js 15 App Router Migration - Status Report

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Context Providers Setup
- ✅ Created `app/providers.tsx` with proper client-side wrapper
- ✅ Added AuthProvider, CartProvider, and WishlistProvider to app layout
- ✅ Fixed SSR issues by adding proper client-side checks in contexts
- ✅ Added missing hook exports (useAuth, useCart, useWishlist)
- ✅ Updated import paths to work with Next.js App Router structure

### 2. Environment Variable Loading
- ✅ Fixed `scripts/check-env.mjs` to properly load .env files
- ✅ Added dotenv package and proper path resolution
- ✅ Environment variables now load correctly during build process

### 3. TypeScript Configuration
- ✅ Updated `tsconfig.json` to include src directory
- ✅ Fixed path mappings to work with both src and app directories
- ✅ Resolved import path issues for context files

### 4. Build System
- ✅ Build compiles successfully (with compile mode)
- ✅ No more missing context provider errors
- ✅ All import errors resolved
- ✅ SSR compatibility ensured with proper client-side guards

## 🔧 Architecture Changes Made

### Context Files Updated:
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Added useAuth hook, SSR guards
- `src/contexts/CartContext.tsx` - Added useCart hook, SSR guards  
- `src/contexts/WishlistContext.tsx` - Added useWishlist hook, SSR guards

### App Router Structure:
- `app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with providers wrapper
- `app/providers.tsx` - Client-side context providers wrapper
- `app/test-contexts/page.tsx` - Test page to verify contexts work

### Configuration Files:
- `tsconfig.json` - Updated to include src directory
- `scripts/check-env.mjs` - Fixed environment variable loading

## 🎯 Current Status

The Next.js 15 App Router migration is **COMPLETE** for the core architecture:

1. ✅ React Context providers are properly integrated
2. ✅ Environment variable loading works correctly
3. ✅ Build system compiles successfully
4. ✅ SSR/Client-side rendering separation is clean
5. ✅ No more hybrid Vite/Next.js architecture issues

## 🧪 Testing

A test page has been created at `/test-contexts` to verify all context providers are working correctly. The build system confirms all contexts are properly integrated.

## 📝 Notes

- Used `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` on some pages to avoid SSR issues during transition
- All context providers now have proper client-side guards for localStorage access
- Import paths have been standardized to use the @/ alias correctly
- The migration maintains backward compatibility with existing component structure

## 🚀 Next Steps

The core migration is complete. The application should now run properly with:
- Working authentication context
- Working cart functionality  
- Working wishlist functionality
- Proper environment variable loading
- Clean Next.js 15 App Router architecture
