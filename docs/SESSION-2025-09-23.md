# Session Notes â€” 2025-09-23

Reference `docs/README.md` for the full documentation index.

## Summary
- Captured the target copilot pipelines in `docs/AGENT-PIPELINES.md` (product-from-media, article drafting, hero updates) so future work follows a consistent script.
- Enhanced the admin assistant UI: structured context panel, toggleable publishing flags, and direct media uploads via the new `/api/admin/assistant/uploads` endpoint.
- Updated workflows (`docs/ADMIN-WORKFLOWS.md`) to document the context drawer and attachment flow; refreshed backlog/plan docs (`docs/NEXT-STEPS.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`) with Phase 15 pipeline milestones.
- Added `npm run assistant:sync` reminder to `AGENTS.md` and indexed the new pipelines doc in `docs/README.md`.

## Verification
- `npm run type-check`

## Follow-ups
- Implement `create_product_full` and `draft_article` assistant actions using the documented pipelines.
- Add assistant session logging + admin viewer once pipelines go live.
- Extend Vitest/Playwright coverage for upload + pipeline flows when backend orchestration ships.
