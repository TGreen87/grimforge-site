# Session Notes — 2025-10-24

## Summary
- Updated `AGENTS.md`, key launch/QA docs, and owner handbook to reflect the remote-first workflow and current Netlify deploy status.
- Added production admin login parity and copilot smoke requirements across checklists so the owner experience matches the branch deploy; production login loop resolved today (2025-10-24).
- Documented the decision to rely on Stripe static shipping rates for launch while keeping the AusPost scaffold for future use.
- Logged the latest guidance in `docs/CONTINUE-PROMPT.md` to keep future agents aligned with the deploy-led process.

## Outstanding
- Run an in-admin copilot smoke on the `dev` branch deploy once OpenAI credentials are confirmed, and capture results in the next session log.
- Accelerate launch readiness tasks (remote smoke, hero/storytelling polish, content proofing) so we can promote `dev → main` confidently.
- Plan targeted work to stabilise `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` when resuming local suite fixes; continue to document attempts.

## Verification
- Remote checks only:
  - `curl https://dev--obsidianriterecords.netlify.app` → `200`
  - `/status` confirms Supabase URL/anon/service keys present under Node 22
  - `/api/shipping/quote` (AU → 3000) returns Stripe static Standard/Express options with `configured:false`
- Remote Puppeteer smoke is still outstanding; blocked on purpose while we avoid local dependency reinstalls.
