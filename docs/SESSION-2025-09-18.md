# Session Log â€” 2025-09-18

## Summary
- Documented updated implementation roadmap covering dashboard 2.0, storefront visual refresh, and third-party integrations.
- Added `docs/SITE-VISUALS-RFC.md` to capture public-site UX strategy.
- Refreshed `docs/NEXT-STEPS.md`, `docs/ADMIN-VISUALS-RFC.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md`, and `AGENTS.md` with new priorities.
- Implemented shared motion presets/components and installed `framer-motion` to unblock hero/dash animations.
- Created Supabase `campaigns` table + admin CRUD (list/cards/create/edit) to manage storefront hero content.
- Added order timeline RPC + admin UI (timeline card on order detail) and secured API endpoint.
- Introduced bulk order status endpoint + UI action ("Mark shipped") and packing slip export.
- Added `admin_settings` table + admin settings screen (alerts thresholds, Slack webhook) and wired dashboard alerts to new config.
- Feature-flagged campaign hero now renders dynamic content when `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_HERO_CAMPAIGN=1` (falls back to legacy hero).
- Bulk cancel/refund flows (with reason capture) added to orders toolbar; audit logs & timeline entries record context.
- Packing slip export now returns branded PDF (with HTML fallback via `?format=html`).
- Slack alerts: added webhook test endpoint + UI button to validate ops notifications.
- Campaign hero enhanced with motion-aware controls, reduced-motion fallback, and optional audio preview playback.
- Planned next execution steps: wire Slack notifications, extend automation coverage, and begin catalog/product refresh.

## Tests
- `npm run lint` (fails on legacy `no-explicit-any` / hook warnings; no new lint regressions introduced).
- `npm run type-check`
- `npm run test:puppeteer`

## Follow-ups
- Continue implementation: wire Slack notifications, upgrade packing slips for branding/email attachment, and expand campaign hero content blocks before catalog refresh.
- Schedule QA for announcement editor + CSV export flows after new automation coverage.
- Await Stripe publishable key and AusPost credentials for wallet/label work.
