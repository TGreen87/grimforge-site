# Session Log â€” 2025-09-18

## Summary
- Documented updated implementation roadmap covering dashboard 2.0, storefront visual refresh, and third-party integrations.
- Added `docs/SITE-VISUALS-RFC.md` to capture public-site UX strategy.
- Refreshed `docs/NEXT-STEPS.md`, `docs/ADMIN-VISUALS-RFC.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md`, and `AGENTS.md` with new priorities.
- Implemented shared motion presets/components and installed `framer-motion` to unblock hero/dash animations.
- Created Supabase `campaigns` table + admin CRUD (list/cards/create/edit) to manage storefront hero content.
- Added order timeline RPC + admin UI (timeline card on order detail) and secured API endpoint.
- Introduced bulk order status endpoint + UI action ("Mark shipped") and packing slip export.
- Planned next execution steps: build bulk order actions/packing slips, configure alert thresholds, and prototype hero feature flag.

## Tests
- `npm run lint` (fails on legacy `no-explicit-any` / hook warnings; no new lint regressions introduced).
- `npm run type-check`
- `npm run test:puppeteer`

## Follow-ups
- Continue implementation: add remaining bulk actions (cancel/refund flows), wire configurable alert thresholds, and prototype hero feature flag.
- Schedule QA for announcement editor + CSV export flows after new automation coverage.
- Await Stripe publishable key and AusPost credentials for wallet/label work.
