# Session Log â€” 2025-09-18

## Summary
- Documented updated implementation roadmap covering dashboard 2.0, storefront visual refresh, and third-party integrations.
- Added `docs/SITE-VISUALS-RFC.md` to capture public-site UX strategy.
- Refreshed `docs/NEXT-STEPS.md`, `docs/ADMIN-VISUALS-RFC.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md`, and `AGENTS.md` with new priorities.
- Implemented shared motion presets/components and installed `framer-motion` to unblock hero/dash animations.
- Planned next execution steps: scaffold hero campaign config, advance dashboard order timeline features, set alert thresholds.

## Tests
- `npm run lint` (fails on legacy `no-explicit-any` / hook warnings; no new lint regressions introduced).
- `npm run type-check`
- `npm run test:puppeteer`

## Follow-ups
- Continue implementation: add Supabase campaign table and admin controls, design order timeline data shape, and wire configurable alert thresholds.
- Schedule QA for announcement editor + CSV export flows after new automation coverage.
- Await Stripe publishable key and AusPost credentials for wallet/label work.
