# ‚úÖ Context Provider Migration - COMPLETE

## Summary
The Next.js 15 App Router migration for React Context providers has been **successfully completed**. All context providers are now properly integrated into the App Router structure.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Context Provider Integration ‚úÖ
- Created `app/providers.tsx` with proper "use client" directive
- Wrapped all three context providers (Auth, Cart, Wishlist) in the app layout
- Added proper SSR guards to prevent localStorage access during server-side rendering

### 2. Missing Hook Exports ‚úÖ
- Added `useAuth` hook export to AuthContext
- Added `useCart` hook export to CartContext  
- Added `useWishlist` hook export to WishlistContext
- All hooks include proper error handling for usage outside providers

### 3. Environment Variable Loading ‚úÖ
- Fixed `scripts/check-env.mjs` to properly load .env files
- Added dotenv dependency and proper path resolution
- Environment variables now load correctly during build process

### 4. TypeScript Configuration ‚úÖ
- Updated `tsconfig.json` to include src directory (was previously excluded)
- Fixed import path mappings for @/ alias
- Resolved all import path issues

### 5. SSR Compatibility ‚úÖ
- Added `typeof window === 'undefined'` checks in all contexts
- Prevented localStorage access during server-side rendering
- Ensured contexts initialize properly on client-side hydration

## Build Status
- ‚úÖ **Compilation**: Successful - no more context import errors
- ‚úÖ **Context Providers**: All working and properly integrated
- ‚úÖ **Environment Variables**: Loading correctly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Static Generation**: Some pages have unrelated SSR issues (not context-related)

## Files Modified
```
app/layout.tsx          - Added Providers wrapper
app/providers.tsx       - NEW: Client-side context wrapper
src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx     - Added useAuth hook + SSR guards
src/contexts/CartContext.tsx     - Added useCart hook + SSR guards  
src/contexts/WishlistContext.tsx - Added useWishlist hook + SSR guards
scripts/check-env.mjs   - Fixed environment variable loading
tsconfig.json          - Fixed src directory inclusion
```

## Verification
The migration was verified by:
1. ‚úÖ Build compilation succeeds (no context import errors)
2. ‚úÖ All context hooks are properly exported
3. ‚úÖ SSR guards prevent server-side localStorage access
4. ‚úÖ Environment variables load correctly
5. ‚úÖ TypeScript configuration includes all necessary files

## Result
üéâ **The React Context provider architecture is now fully migrated to Next.js 15 App Router!**

The app should now run without the previous context-related warnings:
- ‚ùå "AuthContext not found" - FIXED
- ‚ùå "CartContext not found" - FIXED  
- ‚ùå "WishlistContext not found" - FIXED

All context providers are properly wrapped around the application and available to all components.
