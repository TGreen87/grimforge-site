# Session Notes â€” 2025-09-24

## Summary
- Documented current roadmap shift: focus is now on launch readiness; copilot enhancements paused until env/test harness stabilises.
- Updated prompts for chat/product/article pipelines (friendly owner tone, GPT-5 Codex ready).
- Added conversational guardrails so the assistant asks for missing product details instead of failing silently; surfacing API errors in the drawer chat.
- Identified env regression on Netlify (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`/`SUPABASE_URL` missing) and recorded remediation steps.

## Outstanding
- Set Supabase + OpenAI env vars on Netlify, redeploy `dev`, confirm `/status` and `/admin/assistant` succeed.
- Populate storytelling content and capture final storefront/admin screenshots for launch docs.
- Stabilise lint (`npm run lint`) and test (`npm test`) by fixing admin typings and Stripe/checkout mocks; re-enable assistant undo specs.
- Add dashboard automation status panel, campaign live preview/diff, and storytelling drag-and-drop before launch.
- Run `npm run audit:a11y` + Puppeteer smoke once envs/tests are green; archive results in `docs/qa-screenshots/`.

## Verification
- Manual API calls only (Node `tsx`) to repro assistant error; no automated commands (`npm run lint/test`) executed this session.
