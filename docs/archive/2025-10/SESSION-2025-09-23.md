# Session Notes â€” 2025-09-23

Reference `docs/README.md` for the full documentation index.

## Summary
- Completed Phase 2 of the admin copilot: product-from-media, article drafting/publishing, and hero campaign updates now execute end-to-end with OpenAI enrichment and Supabase writes.
- Introduced persistent assistant session logging (`assistant_sessions`, `assistant_session_events`, `assistant_uploads`) and wired every message/action/upload through the audit trail.
- Updated the assistant UI with session-aware requests, attachment auditing, and improved error propagation.
- Added `/admin/assistant/logs` viewer showing session details, event timeline, and uploads for easy auditing.
- Refreshed documentation (`docs/AGENT-PIPELINES.md`, `docs/ADMIN-WORKFLOWS.md`, `docs/NEXT-STEPS.md`, `docs/QA-CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`) to reflect the shipped pipelines and new QA expectations.
- Patched `npm run assistant:sync` after library reshuffle and extended Supabase types to cover the new tables.
- Surfaced multi-step plan previews and instant undo controls for assistant-driven product/article/campaign actions.

## Verification
- `npm run type-check`

## Follow-ups
- Add filtering/search/export refinements to `/admin/assistant/logs` once audit requirements firm up.
- Extend Playwright/Puppeteer coverage to exercise the new pipelines end-to-end once QA creds available.
- Capture owner-facing docs/screenshots that explain plan preview + undo flows.
- Restore Vitest suites (checkout, Stripe webhook, assistant undo) and remove temporary skips once env fixtures are back in place.
