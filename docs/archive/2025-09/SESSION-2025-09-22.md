# Session Notes â€” 2025-09-22

## Summary
- Rebuilt the storefront product detail data flow around typed Supabase rows, normalizing variant inventory joins and retiring `any` usage across `metadata.ts`, the server route, and client-side variant selectors.
- Tightened the article metadata loader to return strongly typed rows, added defensive logging, and aligned the article page with the canonical SEO helper so null fields degrade gracefully.
- Updated JSON-LD emission and product/cart wiring to rely on normalized types, improving runtime safety ahead of the broader lint sprint.
- Deleted redundant `src/lib` SEO, Stripe, and Supabase shims and promoted `lib/supabase/types.ts` as the canonical re-export so future imports stay consistent.

## Verification
- `npm run lint` (fails: legacy `no-explicit-any` debt across admin modules and shared contexts persists; storefront product files no longer surface errors).
- `npm run type-check` (pass).

## Follow-ups
- Continue ESLint debt reduction in admin dashboards (`UploadProduct`, inventory tables, analytics client) before re-running full lint gate.
- Track remaining `@/src/lib/*` imports (storage helpers) for future consolidation once contexts migrate to shared utilities.
- Schedule Puppeteer smoke once lint fixes land to ensure product detail regressions are absent with real Supabase data.
