# Documentation Archive

Older session logs and working notes move here to keep `docs/` focused on current guides. Files are grouped by year-month folders (e.g., `2025-09/`). When creating new session notes, add them to the root `docs/SESSION-YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Periodically relocate older entries into the appropriate archive folder.
