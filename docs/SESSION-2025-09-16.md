# Session Notes — 2025-09-16

## Summary
- Stabilised the product detail page by moving variant/cart UI into `app/(site)/products/[slug]/variant-client-block.tsx` and importing it directly from the server component (no more server-side `useState` errors).
- Added a `legal/` route group with initial copy for Shipping, Returns, Size Guide, Care, Contact, Privacy, and Terms so footer links resolve.
- Hardened `scripts/puppeteer-smoke.mjs` to wait for slug hydration, drop the flaky catalog navigation, and fetch robots/sitemap using `networkidle0`. Smoke now covers homepage → vinyl anchor → seeded product slug → robots/sitemap → admin login with fresh screenshots in `docs/qa-screenshots/`.
- Updated documentation (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md`, `docs/NEXT-STEPS.md`, `docs/CONTINUE-PROMPT.md`) to capture the new workflow and maintenance process.

## Outstanding
- Review legal copy for tone/accuracy.
- Reintroduce cart/checkout coverage into the smoke test once seeded data and secrets allow.
- Continue admin UX polish (bulk tooling, accessibility) per `docs/NEXT-STEPS.md`.
