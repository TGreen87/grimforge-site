# Session Notes — 2025-11-01

## Summary
- Provisioned Netlify `dev` environment variables for Stripe (secret, publishable, webhook, test route toggles, site URL) and triggered a redeploy to pick them up.
- Replaced `lib/stripe.ts` with a cached `getStripe` helper and added `/api/stripe/health` plus a minimal webhook endpoint that validates signatures and logs checkout completions.
- Added `/order/success` and `/order/cancel` pages so Stripe redirects never 404; the success view now fetches receipt details server-side.
- Updated `/test/checkout` to report backend error codes so we can debug checkout issues without digging through logs.
- Hardened `/api/checkout` success/cancel URLs to derive from the request origin with a safe Netlify fallback.
- Documented all of the above in `AGENTS.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md`, `docs/NEXT-STEPS.md`, and refreshed the continuation prompt for hand-off.

## Outstanding
- Run the assistant/copilot smoke on the `dev` branch deploy once OpenAI creds are available and log outcomes.
- Execute the remote Puppeteer smoke and capture updated screenshots for the storefront and admin after the Stripe changes.
- Stabilise local lint/test/build pipelines when the known admin typings and Stripe/AusPost mocks can be addressed.
- Confirm `/api/stripe/webhook` end-to-end once the live webhook secret is finalised; currently logging only.

## Verification
- Netlify CLI `env:get` confirms Stripe secrets are populated for the `dev` context.
- `curl https://dev--obsidianriterecords.netlify.app/status` → `200`, Supabase keys present.
- `curl https://dev--obsidianriterecords.netlify.app/api/stripe/health` (after deploy) should return `{ "ok": true }` once the redeploy completes (pending human check).
