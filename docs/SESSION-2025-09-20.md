# Session Log — 2025-09-20

## Summary
- Hardened storefront navigation and hero controls with explicit aria labels so icon-only buttons are screen-reader friendly.
- Updated catalog filters to forward accessible names to Radix sliders and wired export buttons with aria-labels.
- Added `scripts/accessibility-report.mjs` plus `npm run audit:a11y` to automate Lighthouse accessibility scans for home and admin dashboard.
- Captured fresh Puppeteer screenshots and Lighthouse JSON reports (home score 1.00, admin 0.82 — dashboard items queued for contrast/label fixes).
- Noted outstanding Lighthouse items for admin (progressbar names, breadcrumb target size, disabled button contrast, unlabeled announcement textarea); follow-up scheduled after code deploy.

## Validation
- `npm run type-check`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run test:puppeteer`
- `npm run audit:a11y`

## Next Actions
1. Redeploy branch to Netlify and rerun `npm run audit:a11y` to confirm slider accessible-name fixes land (scores should climb once new build is live).
2. Investigate remaining admin dashboard accessibility findings from `lighthouse-admin-dashboard.json` (score 0.82) and prioritise remediation.
3. Extend Puppeteer script to capture Journal fallback state when storytelling surfaces are empty.
4. Add Vitest coverage for story content RPCs after content endpoints settle.
5. Schedule automated aXe/Lighthouse runs post visual refresh and log outcomes in QA checklist.
