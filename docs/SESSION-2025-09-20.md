# Session Log — 2025-09-20

## Summary
- Hardened storefront navigation and hero controls with explicit aria labels so icon-only buttons are screen-reader friendly.
- Updated catalog filters to forward accessible names to Radix sliders and wired export buttons with aria-labels.
- Added `scripts/accessibility-report.mjs` plus `npm run audit:a11y` to automate Lighthouse accessibility scans for home and admin dashboard.
- Captured fresh Puppeteer screenshots and Lighthouse JSON reports (home score 1.00, admin 0.97 after color contrast fix still pending).
- Noted remaining admin Lighthouse issue (`color-contrast`) tied to disabled review buttons; plan to update disabled styling next.

## Validation
- `npm run type-check`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run test:puppeteer`
- `npm run audit:a11y`

## Next Actions
1. Adjust dashboard disabled button styling (needs fulfilment) to meet contrast targets, rerun `npm run audit:a11y` to confirm ≥0.98 score.
2. Extend Puppeteer script to capture Journal fallback state when storytelling surfaces are empty.
3. Add Vitest coverage for story content RPCs after content endpoints settle.
4. Schedule automated aXe/Lighthouse runs post visual refresh and log outcomes in QA checklist.
5. Plan Slack/alert threshold wiring once secrets arrive, then regression-test alerts and re-run accessibility audits.
