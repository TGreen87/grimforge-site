# Session Notes — 2025-09-14

Meeting to align storefront preview stability, admin UX polish, and deployment hygiene ahead of Sprint 1 hand-off.

## Highlights
- **Supabase bootstrap**: Agreed on "No-DO Seed" script that creates `variants`/`inventory`, adds the QA product (`test-vinyl-dark-rituals`), and grants the preview admin role. Documented in `docs/SUPABASE-SEED.md`.
- **Observability**: Shipped `/api/client-logs`, client beacon logger, correlation ID middleware, and ErrorBoundary mounting order. Rate limiting + dedupe confirmed.
- **Shipping**: Locked strategy to customer-pays; AusPost quotes when env present with Stripe static fallback otherwise. `/api/shipping/quote` returns `configured` flag for smoke tests.
- **Product detail**: Variant selector and JSON-LD live; fallback metadata guards added to avoid SSR 500s when Supabase is slow.
- **Admin shell**: Dark theme tokens, sticky headers, density toggle, Cards/Board views, CSV export, and warm EmptyStates accepted for Sprint 1 scope.
- **Branch discipline**: `dev` remains the single working branch. `main` only receives fast-forward merges after branch deploy QA + explicit “Go live on main”.

## Decisions
1. **Environment safety**: Keep Supabase keys in Netlify env; never hard-code secrets. `/status` page remains the runtime checklist.
2. **Preview auth**: Relax client gating on branch deploys; production will enforce admin role via middleware + server checks.
3. **QA baseline**: Puppeteer smoke (homepage → vinyl anchor → product → checkout) becomes the minimum acceptance prior to merging.
4. **Docs cadence**: Update `docs/NEXT-STEPS.md` and `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` after each working session; log major environment changes here.

## Follow-ups
- Tighten production admin gating (middleware role check + `/admin/validate` endpoint feedback).
- Finish Articles MVP (public list/detail + admin editor) post Sprint 1 polish.
- Flesh out bulk tooling (price/active imports) once flag `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ADMIN_BULK` is exercised.
- Capture screenshots for the new admin shell in `docs/qa-screenshots/` after the next QA run.
