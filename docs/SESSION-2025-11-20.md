# Session Notes — 2025-11-20

## Summary
- Analyzed project structure and history following update from `dev_stripe` to `main`.
- Removed legacy code (`src/__legacy_pages`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/main.tsx`).
- Organized migrations (`supabase/migrations/20250122_rls_test_matrix.sql` -> `tests/sql/`).
- Fixed linting errors in `src/services/shipping/auspost.ts` and `src/hooks/useActiveSection.ts`.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to reflect `dev_stripe` usage and Stripe progress.

## Outstanding
- `npm run type-check` still has known failures related to admin typings.
- `npm run test` has known failures due to mocks.
- Need to verify Stripe Checkout flow manually or via remote smoke.

## Verification
- `npm run lint` is cleaner (remaining warnings are non-critical).
- File structure is cleaner without legacy SPA files.
