# Session Notes — 2025-11-20

## Summary
- Cleaned up unused legacy SPA files under `src/__legacy_pages`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/main.tsx` (not used by App Router).
- Kept Stripe + Supabase flow unchanged; minor type tidy-ups in `auspost.ts` and API handlers.
- Restored migrations to `supabase/migrations/20250122_rls_test_matrix.sql` (should live with other migrations, not under tests/).
- Updated navigation approach (anchors/native navigation) remains the current fix for Netlify router issues.

## Outstanding
- `npm run type-check` / `npm run test` still expected to fail on admin typings/mocks—document if you re-run.
- Continue manual Stripe checkout smoke on branch deploys.

## Verification
- Netlify `dev_stripe` build is green after navigation changes; no new build run locally in this session.
