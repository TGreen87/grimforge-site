# Session Notes â€” 2025-09-19

Reference `docs/README.md` for the latest documentation map.

## Highlights
- Added campaign layout metadata (layout, badge text, highlight bullets) to Supabase via migration and extended admin create/edit/list views to manage the new fields.
- Rebuilt the storefront campaign hero to support Classic, Split, and Minimal layouts with improved reduced-motion handling, accessible media controls, and optional highlight bullets.
- Updated QA/launch checklists, owner/admin guides, RFCs, and continuation prompt to document the new hero capabilities and expectations.

## Follow-ups
- Extend Puppeteer smoke to capture hero layout permutations once automated screenshot budget allows.
- Continue storefront enhancements: catalog quick actions, product gallery lightbox, storytelling blocks.
- Keep Stripe/AusPost integrations flagged for activation when credentials arrive; hero remains feature-flagged until final sign-off.
