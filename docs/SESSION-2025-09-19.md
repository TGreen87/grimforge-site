# Session Notes â€” 2025-09-19

Reference `docs/README.md` for the latest documentation map.

## Highlights
- Added campaign layout metadata (layout, badge text, highlight bullets) to Supabase via migration and extended admin create/edit/list views to manage the new fields.
- Rebuilt the storefront campaign hero to support Classic, Split, and Minimal layouts with improved reduced-motion handling, accessible media controls, and optional highlight bullets.
- Updated QA/launch checklists, owner/admin guides, RFCs, and continuation prompt to document the new hero capabilities and expectations.
- Implemented catalog card quick actions (Add to cart, Wishlist, Quick view) with keyboard/focus support.
- Added dashboard revenue goal card with configurable targets (7/30 day windows) and settings integration.
- Introduced product detail gallery lightbox with thumbnail navigation and sticky buy module for faster checkout access.
- Storytelling blocks now source from Supabase tables with admin UI for timeline/testimonials and newsletter copy.
- Checkout sheet now uses a multi-step slide-over with wallet placeholder messaging (awaiting publishable key).

## Follow-ups
- Extend Puppeteer smoke to capture hero layout permutations once automated screenshot budget allows.
- Continue storefront enhancements: catalog quick actions, product gallery lightbox, storytelling blocks.
- Keep Stripe/AusPost integrations flagged for activation when credentials arrive; hero remains feature-flagged until final sign-off.
