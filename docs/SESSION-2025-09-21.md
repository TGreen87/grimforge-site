# Session Notes — 2025-09-21

## Summary
- Replaced all public-facing contact references with `arg@obsidianriterecords.com` and kept placeholders generic to avoid leaking the owner inbox.
- Restored full functionality to footer socials (Instagram opens in new tab) and ensured the newsletter/signup prompts share neutral copy.
- Hardened storefront auth: removed demo account hints, added Google sign-in to both tabs, and kept Supabase OAuth wiring consistent.
- Extended `scripts/puppeteer-smoke.mjs` to clear auth state, log in with provided admin creds, and allow screenshot suppression via `QA_CAPTURE_SHOTS=0`.

## Verification
- 21:18 UTC — `QA_CAPTURE_SHOTS=0 ADMIN_EMAIL=codex@greenaiautomation.ai ADMIN_PASSWORD=*** node scripts/puppeteer-smoke.mjs` (admin login succeeds; product create + Stripe still warn pending upstream fixes).
- 21:38 UTC — `npx vitest run tests/seo/jsonld.test.tsx`.
- `npm run lint` still fails on legacy `any` usage and Fast Refresh warnings (unchanged).

## Follow-ups
- Decide whether to guard the admin product/checkout portion of the smoke script behind an env flag.
- Plan lint debt remediation when ready (numerous `no-explicit-any` hits across app/admin and product pages).
- Confirm ESP vs. n8n newsletter integration direction before wiring the production signup flow.
