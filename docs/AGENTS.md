# Documentation Maintenance Guide

Use this note to keep project docs aligned when the plan evolves.

- Update the root `AGENTS.md` whenever workflows change (branch discipline, QA process, env checklist).
- Mirror key project milestones in `docs/SESSION-*.md` and `docs/NEXT-STEPS.md`.
- After each working block, push `dev` so Netlify redeploys and the branch deploy stays current.
- Keep `docs/SUPABASE-SEED.md` synced with any schema or policy changes.
